              activities include (but are not limited to) Public Education and Hazard Mitigation.  Some examples of Public Education are including helpful Brochures on this website, encouraging people to attend trainings such as a First Aid Workshop and/or a CERT (Community Emergency Response Team) training.  An example of Hazard Mitigation is identifying an area in a community which is prone to flooding, then taking the necessary steps to minimize the flooding.  In this example, the goal of Hazard Mitigation is to reduce future of damage to property and possible loss of life due to flooding.

              PREPAREDNESS
            </h2>
            <p class="leading-relaxed">
              activities include (but are not limited to) creating and updating an Emergency Operations Plan (EOP) for each municipality.  The Basic Plan used by each municipality in Pennsylvania is a way to prepare for Emergencies and Disasters using a standard format based on NIMS guidelines (the National Incident Management System) and ICS guidelines (the Incident Command System).  NIMS and ICS provide a standardized way to deal with emergencies and disasters.  Another preparedness activity is to form Mutual Aid Agreements with other local municipalities.  These agreements simply state that municipalities will help each other with resources during emergencies and/or disasters.

              activities may include (but are not limited to) Evacuation and/or Shelter in Place notices or instructions.  A perfect example of an Evacuation Notice occurs frequently in coastal communities prone to Hurricanes.  A local EMA, with the authority of the local government, may recommend to the public to evacuate when severe weather is imminent.

              activities may include (but are not limited to) Damage Assessment and Reporting.  For example, a local municipality may be able to receive some monetary compensation for expenses due to a disaster if a Disaster Declaration was made by the PA State Government and the local authority;  the expenses must be reported through the County EMA.
